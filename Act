The business task at hand was to analyze smart device usage data from a third party to identify trends and insights that can be applied to Bellabeatâ€™s products. After a thorough analysis, I have distilled the following insights and recommendations for the Bellabeat Marketing and Executive teams:

 I found that the greater the percentage of time a user spends being highly active, the more calories they burn. So not only does the amount of activity impact the number of calories burned, but the intensity of the activity matters too. Bellabeat can use this insight to recommend high-intensity workouts to users who have a goal of burning calories, such as those who are interested in losing weight. Similarly, they can market their products as tools to help women through their weight-loss journey.
